Example argument: I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one, and I want her to fit in with the other kids.
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is an ad populum fallacy, relying on the popularity of iPhones among schoolchildren as justification for buying one, rather than on merit or need.
Fallacy type: ad populum

Example argument: The lady in the pink dress is Julia Roberts.
The reporter thinks Julia Roberts drives a Prius.
Therefore, the reporter thinks the lady in the pink dress drives a Prius.
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is a deductive fallacy because it assumes that the reporter's belief about Julia Roberts driving a Prius extends to the woman in the pink dress without confirming the identity link.
Fallacy type: deductive fallacy

Example argument: Customer: The cake has a cherry on top. Baker: So you're saying that it's filled with cherries? That's just absurd.
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is a fallacy of extension; the baker exaggerates the customer's comment about a cherry on top into a claim that the entire cake must be filled with cherries.
Fallacy type: fallacy of extension

Example argument: Person A: I spent the day at the beach. Person B: So you're saying you have time to spend all day doing nothing, lazing around on the beach?
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is a fallacy of extension where Person B unfairly twists Person Aâ€™s neutral statement into a judgment about laziness.
Fallacy type: fallacy of extension

Example argument: Not all electric cars are eco-friendly. Even Tesla has critics.
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is a fallacy of credibility; it suggests that because Tesla has critics, electric cars as a whole are not eco-friendly, which unfairly dismisses the broader argument based on selective authority.
Fallacy type: fallacy of credibility

Example argument: I read a joke but no one can prove it is funny. So the joke is not funny.
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is an intentional fallacy, treating the joke's humor as something that must be objectively proven rather than being understood in context or subjectively.
Fallacy type: intentional fallacy

Example argument: Person #1: We need to start high school later in the morning.
Person #2: Oh, so you think we should all just sleep in until noon and have school until it gets dark?
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is a fallacy of extension, where the second person distorts a reasonable suggestion about later school start times into an exaggerated and impractical proposal.
Fallacy type: fallacy of extension

Example argument: Morris: Oh youthful spirit, you have so much to learn.  I know for a fact that there are multiple dimensions that beings occupy.
Clifton: How can you possibly *know* that for a fact?
Morris: (raises one eyebrow, stares deeply into the eyes of Clifton and says nothing)
Clifton: Wow. You convinced me!
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is a fallacy of relevance; the response relies on mysticism and theatrics rather than evidence, failing to logically support the claim about multiple dimensions.
Fallacy type: fallacy of relevance

Example argument: Person 1: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings. Person 2: So you're suggesting that management encourages pest infestation and ruins property values through pet allowance? That's a ridiculous notion.
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is a fallacy of extension; the second person grossly misrepresents a benign statement about pet policies as advocating for pest infestation.
Fallacy type: fallacy of extension

Example argument: First senator: The nation is in debt and we should not add to the defense budget.
Second senator: I cannot believe you want to leave the nation defenseless!
Correct reasoning and fallacy: This is a fallacy of extension; the second senator distorts a call for fiscal responsibility into an accusation of wanting to leave the nation defenseless.
Fallacy type: fallacy of extension
